When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When you are working across devices it makes sense to create a remote repository.
    This could be because you personally work on different computers.
    Likewise of course if you want to work with other people it makes sense that you'd want
     them to be able to access the repository from their own devices.
    Another scenario is if you are the sole creator of a project and only work on one device,
     but want to share the project with others online. For instance if you've made a mod or
     an API or something amongst those lines.
    Finally it can be a way to back-up your files remotely, to protect you for when your local
     device is destroyed or stolen etc.
